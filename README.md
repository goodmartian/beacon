## üö® The Problem

Every year, 500,000+ people are trapped in disaster zones without communication:
- Cell towers fail or become overloaded
- Internet infrastructure is destroyed
- People cannot call for help or find safety
- Rescuers cannot locate survivors efficiently
- **Every minute of delay costs lives**

---

## üí° The Solution

Beacon creates a **hybrid communication system** combining:
1. **Bluetooth Mesh Network** - Phone-to-phone communication (no infrastructure needed)
2. **NASA Satellite Data** - Real-time fire, flood, and earthquake information
3. **Intelligent Routing** - AI prioritization for rescue operations

**Unique Innovation:** First platform combining crowd-powered mesh networks with space-based hazard intelligence.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Core Functionality
- ‚úÖ **Bluetooth Mesh Networking** - Messages relay through intermediate devices (30-100m per hop)
- ‚úÖ **SOS Broadcasting** - One-tap emergency activation with automatic location sharing
- ‚úÖ **NASA Data Integration** - Real-time disaster data from FIRMS, floods, earthquakes
- ‚úÖ **Dual UI Modes** - Normal (green/maps) vs Emergency (black/battery-save)
- ‚úÖ **Offline-First** - All critical features work without internet
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Activation** - Earthquake detection via accelerometer

### Message Types
| Type | Priority | Size | Function |
|------|----------|------|----------|
| SOS Signal | CRITICAL | 128 bytes | Emergency broadcast + GPS |
| Medical Status | HIGH | 64 bytes | Injured/Safe/Critical |
| Text Message | HIGH | 512 bytes | Communication |
| GPS Location | HIGH | 64 bytes | Position updates |
| Battery Level | MEDIUM | 16 bytes | Power status |

## üß™ Testing

### Multi-Device Testing (Required)
Bluetooth mesh requires **minimum 2 physical Android devices:**

```bash
# Install on both devices
flutter install

# Device A: Activate SOS
# Device B: Should receive alert within 3 seconds
```

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Direct communication (2 devices)
2. Multi-hop relay (3+ devices)
3. NASA data display
4. Auto-activation (shake device)
5. Battery drain (30 min test)

### Unit Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

## üì± How It Works

### 1. Mesh Network Formation
```
Device A ‚Üê‚Üí Device B ‚Üê‚Üí Device C
    ‚Üï           ‚Üï           ‚Üï
Device D ‚Üê‚Üí Device E ‚Üê‚Üí Device F
```
- Automatic BLE discovery
- Self-organizing topology
- 30-100 meter range per hop
- Supports unlimited devices

### 2. Message Relay
```
[Alice activates SOS]
    ‚Üì
[Message hops through Bob]
    ‚Üì
[Reaches rescue team at Charlie]
```
- Priority-based transmission
- Deduplication (no loops)
- TTL-based hop limits
- <3 second latency per hop

### 3. NASA Data Sync
```
[Device with internet] ‚Üí Fetches NASA data
    ‚Üì
[Broadcasts to mesh]
    ‚Üì
[All devices cache for 24 hours]
```
- Real-time fire locations (FIRMS)
- Flood zones
- Earthquake epicenters
- Offline caching

## üé® UI Modes

### Normal Mode
- **Color:** Safety Green (#2ECC71)
- **Display:** Map with NASA hazard overlays
- **Status:** Device count, battery, network
- **Action:** Large SOS activation button

### Emergency Mode
- **Color:** Black background (OLED battery save)
- **Display:** Pulsing red SOS circle
- **Status:** "X people hear you" + direction to safety
- **Actions:** Safe / Medical / Message buttons

---

## üîã Battery Optimization

**Target:** 48+ hours in emergency mode

**Strategies:**
- Black OLED background (-30% display power)
- Reduced BLE scan frequency
- Low-power location updates
- Message batching
- Sleep mode when idle
